# Get External Data (get-external-data)
Google Tag Manager Custom Variable Template for receiving file contents / data from external url or simple APIs using a GET request


## Usage
Define any URL as input value. The variable will call that URL in a GET request and return the response body as value. If the result is a JSON string, you can use https://github.com/mbaersch/extract-json to extract a single key from the response.
